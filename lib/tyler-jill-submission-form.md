 ## Risk Taking
 - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
 Most people went the array route to add new pellets to the end of their snake, however, Tyler is a linked list master.  This part of the project definitely took us the longest (~15 hours total), but at the end of the day, it was the best method to avoid future errors.

 - How do you feel about those risks?
 After over 10 hours on this one piece of functionality, we were annoyed, exhausted, and wondering if we had been wasting our time on not doing the array method for lists.  As we all know though, linked lists are notorious for interview questions so we are happy that we worked through it.

 ### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
 - We came a very long way in this project from not even being able to ask Jeff R. for questions on day one to debugging the crap out of some scary looking code.
