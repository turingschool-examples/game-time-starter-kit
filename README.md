# Snake - A Game Time project for Turing School

This ain't yo momma's snake from her old nokia phone!  This Javascript written game takes a page out of Samuel L. Jackson and has been dubbed "Rakes on a Plane."  Use your arrow keys to move and if you are feeling saucy, give SLJ mode a try as it speeds up and appends more snakes!

Press 'e' for easy, 'm' for medium, 'h' for hard, or 's' for SAMUEL L JACKSON mode for the risk takers out there to start the game.
