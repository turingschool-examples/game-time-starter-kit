#### Space Invaders 
This game was designed as a project for the [Turing School](https://www.turing.io/) to test 
our ability to build a browser game in javascript. This is accomplished by using the html canvas 
element along with javascript on a single page. Accompanying this game is a test suite using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
and [chai](http://chaijs.com/).
