## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
YES, FINALLY!

 - If not, list what functionality is missing.

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
Extension #1:

- ![levels](http://g.recordit.co/Hnz9omrCEV.gif)

Extension #2:
- Add CRAZY MODE where snake adds more snakes and goes even faster!!
- ![crazy-mode](http://g.recordit.co/YVuf2Tkqpq.gif)

## Risk Taking
- What risks did you feel you took on this project?
Most people went the array route to add new pellets to the end of their snake, however, Tyler is a linked list master.  This part of the project definitely took us the longest (~15 hours total), but at the end of the day, it was the best method to avoid future errors.

- How do you feel about those risks?
After over 10 hours on this one piece of functionality, we were annoyed, exhausted, and wondering if we had been wasting our time on not doing the array method for lists.  As we all know though, linked lists are notorious for interview questions so we are happy that we worked through it.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- [good-code](https://github.com/jillmd501/Rakes-on-a-Plane-JS/blob/master/lib/snake.js#L24-L30)
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
  We were able to figure out recursion before Steve even did his lesson!  This block of code is when recursion finally 'clicked!'

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- [bad-code](https://github.com/jillmd501/Rakes-on-a-Plane-JS/blob/master/lib/game.js#L19-L31)
- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
  This is a hacky way to prevent the snake from thinking it runs into itself when it eats moving to the left and is less than pretty.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
